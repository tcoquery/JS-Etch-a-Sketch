# Etch-a-Sketch

Second project of The Odin Project.

This is a revisit of the classic game Etch A Sketch. You can draw anything you want by hovering the grid cells, however, like the classic game, you cannot interrupt the drawing.

This project involved using DOM manipulation for the first time as well as grids.
